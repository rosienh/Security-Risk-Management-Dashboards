## Security Risk Management Dashboards

This repository showcases two pivotal Power BI dashboards developed for Security Risk Department: the **Risk Assessment Scheduling Report** and the **Security Risk Reporting dashboard**. These tools were designed to transform manual, Excel-based data processes into automated, insightful visualizations for enhanced security risk management. The Risk Assessment Scheduling Report provides an overview of planned and in-progress assessments, while the Security Risk Reporting dashboard deep dives into identified risks and control effectiveness.
